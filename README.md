# Deep Learning

Solutions to the assignments of [Google's Deep Learning MOOC](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) on Udacity.<br>
May not be the best solutions, but they work.<br>
Data for the assignments is really large. So, they won't be uploaded.

**Note:** If you're planning on running these on your machine, it is recommended that you have `tensorflow-gpu` installed. It's the GPU version of `tensorflow` and is much faster than the normal CPU version. You'll need that speed because some of the trainings I've done could take hours on CPUs (!!!) but will finish within a minute on GPUs.
